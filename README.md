# 🍕 Fast React Pizza Co.

### 🚀 [Live Demo → Fast React Pizza Co.](https://fast-pizzaco.netlify.app/)

A simple, modern, and user-friendly pizza ordering web app built with **React**, **Redux Toolkit**, and **Tailwind CSS**.

---

## 📝 Description

**Fast React Pizza Co.** is a responsive pizza ordering application that allows users to browse pizzas, add them to a cart, and place an order — all without needing an account.  
Built using the latest React technologies, it demonstrates concepts like **global state management**, **routing**, and **API integration** in a clean and minimal design.

---

## ⚙️ How It Works

1. Users place an order by submitting their details (name, phone number, address, and selected pizzas).  
2. The order is sent as a **POST request** to the API.  
3. The API returns a **unique order ID**, which is displayed to the user for future tracking.  
4. Orders can later be retrieved or updated (e.g., marked as “priority”).

## ✨ Features

✅ **No Account Required**  
Just enter your name to start ordering — no login or password needed.

✅ **Dynamic Menu**  
The pizza menu is fetched live from an API, so you always see the most updated options.

✅ **Easy Ordering**  
Add multiple pizzas, enter your info, and order in one step.

✅ **Priority Orders**  
Need your pizza fast? Mark your order as “priority” (20% extra) for quick delivery.

✅ **Post-Order Modifications**  
Changed your mind? You can still mark your order as “priority” after placing it.

✅ **Payment on Delivery**  
No credit cards needed — pay when your pizza arrives.

✅ **Unique Order ID**  
Every order gets a unique ID for easy lookup later.
